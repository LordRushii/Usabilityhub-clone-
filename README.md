# Usabilityhub-clone-
ðŸŽ¯ UsabilityHub Landing Page Clone A pixel-perfect clone of UsabilityHubâ€™s landing page, built using just HTML &amp; CSS (yes, no JavaScript sorcery here). Responsive? Of course â€” it bends better than most people's morals. Just a small learning project while I casually flex my frontend skills.


â€œBuilt it with pure HTML & CSS â€” no frameworks, no fluff, just clean code and caffeine.
