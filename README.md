ðŸŽ¯ UsabilityHub Landing Page Clone A pixel-perfect clone of UsabilityHubâ€™s landing page, built using just HTML &amp; CSS (yes, no JavaScript sorcery here). Responsive? Of course â€” it bends better than most people's morals. Just a small learning project while I casually flex my frontend skills.
